				<p>Interiors are what make up any good build, without them we relinquish all exterior detail that we originally added as it simply doesnâ€™t have any purpose. For example, someone could create a beautiful looking exterior, but when the player attempts to enter the structure, there's no interior to be found. While we do not struggle in this aspect on Ardacraft, the quality of which we build our interiors could be improved in one or more ways.<p>
				<p><b>Purpose</b><p>
				<p>When creating an interior the first and most important factor is purpose. It makes the world seem more alive and gives off the illusion that it would be able to function if it weren't made out of blocks. Adding purpose to your interior can either make or break it, depending on what your building. If you're building something such as a watermill, take into factor the amount of room required to successfully power the mill in real life. I also strongly encourage that researching the profession of whoever lives in your house, not only does it give you a better idea of what rooms to designate to what, but it also provides you with inspiration for what to build. Here's a great example of purpose in the watermill in Hobbiton.<p>
				<p><b>Detail</b><p>
				<p>Perhaps the second most important factor when developing your interior is detail. Without detailing your interior it begins to become bland and mundane. Here are a few scenarios where detailing your interior has a large impact.<p>
				<p><b>Appeal And Time Period</b><p>
				<p>While this category connects to purpose in some ways, there are certain aspects in an interior that keep the server define what time period that we're set in. In terms of Earth history we're in a medieval-esque era, which means that most houses would not own too many books as most of the population would be illiterate, and would not have any expensive colored fabric, (such as purple carpet.) The example's below show the difference between appealing and not appealing, along with what time period the build is set in.<p>

				<p><b><ins>Management</ins></b><p>
				<p>The project will be managed and overseen by a small group of admins who will effectively have the same day-to-day duties as normal builders. Their only extra role will be to approve builder applications and project applications (see below), and to make sure things are running smoothly.<p>		
                <p><b><ins>Whitelist and Builder Applications</ins></b><p>
				<p>The project will not have a whitelist, so that anyone can join and look around (though be unable to break blocks). For people who are not already known and trusted from MCME, however, the project will need a system for determining a player's building skill.<p>
                <p>If a player wants to build in ArdaCraft, he or she will have to pass this <a href="http://ardacraft.me/application">application</a>. These builds will take place in a plotworld (running in a separate world on the server) where they could build their stuff to apply with. If an application isn't deemed promotion material, then the reviewer could set an alternative build to build to see how the applicant copes. Rinse and repeat until he/she convinces otherwise.<p>
                <p><b><ins>Build Process</ins></b><p>
				<p>Given the relatively small number of builders, individual areas will be focused on rather than spreading our resources thin. Here is how we will go about building:<p>
				<p><b>Style conceptualisation:</b> Firstly, styles (such as the Shire/Bree-land, Arnor, Lindon and so on), would have a concepts thread, where they can be developed and figured out (already got one for the Shire/Bree-land).<p>
				<p><b>Area planning:</b> First phase: A small group of dedicated people will be commissioned make a document summarizing the details related to a specific project. Every project will be approached through lore-oriented, historical, architectural, economical and political angles, as well as providing evidence of historical analogies that can be found out in our worldâ€™s history. That way we would have a document that to provide us with enough information to start an educated debate on the way our projects should be tackled.<p>
                <p>Second phase: After this, areas (such as the Shire, Harlindon, or the Trollshaws) would be planned out through community collaboration on the forums with guidance from their respective research documents, with smaller projects (such as villages or ruins) marked out within them.<p>
                <p><b>Project applications:</b> In a WesterosCraft-inspired system, an individual builder would then be able to come up with concepts for one of these smaller projects, and then attempt to pass <a href="http://ardacraft.me/forum/m/23052877/viewthread/16509011-project-application-template">this application</a> in order to build it on the server.<p>
                <p>For example, one might apply to lead a village in the Shire. After researching the relevant lore, you would make an overhead plan of the village (a miniature in Minecraft would also work), making sure that individual houses/holes/other buildings have specific purposes (whether it be house, food storage, leather tanner, rope-maker or whatever). You would then come up with a few concepts for it, and post the application.<p>
                <p>Only a certain number of projects will be open for application at any one time. The projects which are currently open can be seen in <a href="http://ardacraft.me/forum/m/23052877/viewthread/16838629-open-project-applications">this thread</a>. Once a project is opened up in this thread, builders should PM me with their intent to apply for this project. If this is not done quickly, then I may simply accept the first person able to get their application in. A minimum of 24 hours must pass before any project is accepted, to allow time for comments.<p>
				<p>Once a project is accepted, the project leader would then post a discussion thread about his or her project in the 'Projects' section with all information pertaining to the project (essentially a reformatting of his or her project application in some ways). This would serve as a project discussion thread, in which people could bring up suggestions or concerns as the project progresses.<p>
				<p>Something to note here: The project leader will have complete authority and creative control over his or her project during its construction. As a result, those helping out should not be offended if the project leader decides to edit whatever they have built, though they can of course raise their concerns either with the project leader directly or in the discussion thread.<p>
				<p>When a project is declared finished by the project leader, it will undergo a review process. This will consist of members of the community posting any final thoughts or suggestions for the project before it is declared completed entirely.<p>
				<p><b>Significant locations:</b> For larger or more lore-heavy locations, such as Fornost, Bree or Rivendell, the process would be slightly different. The admins would firstly create a plan for the area, and then a thread would be created in which ideas and concepts could be posted by the wider community. This would allow all builders to have a say and get their ideas implemented in such locations, whilst maintaining a guiding force in the project.<p>
				<p>The general intention of this system is to:<p>
                <p>a) Focus on building, and reduce admin/bureaucracy to a minimum<p>
				<p>b) Allow as much innovation and creativity as possible to be expressed in the builds, so that quality, detail and individuality become ArdaCraft's hallmarks.<p>
